node-flags
==========

Simple module for parsing double-dash flags in node.

## Install

    $ npm install node-flags
    
## Usage

This module parses double-dash flags from node's process.argv object. Flags are specified when running
a node script. For example:

    $ node server --foo=bar
    
To use, require in the module:

    var flags = require("node-flags");
    var foo = flags.get('foo');
    
The `flags.get()` method parses flags with the following behavior: 

  - A flag with the value of `FALSE`, `false`, `TRUE`, or `true` is parsed as a boolean.
  - A flag with the value of `0` or `1` is parsed as a number.
  - A flag that is exists, but has no value is parsed as boolean true.
  - A flag that does not exist is parsed as boolean false.
  - A flag that exists and has any other value is parsed as a string.

## Test

    $ npm test
    
## Changelog

  - As of **0.1.6**, flags with values of 0 or 1 are parsed as numbers.
